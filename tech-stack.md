# Tech Stack Recommendations

Based on simplicity and robustness for our MVP, here is the recommended tech stack:

### Front-End

- **HTML5 & CSS3:**  
  Use plain HTML5 for structure and CSS3 (or a lightweight framework like TailwindCSS) for styling. This ensures a clean, responsive UI.

- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):**  
  Write the simulation logic and UI interactions in plain JavaScript. This keeps the stack lean and minimizes overhead.

- **HTML5 Canvas:**  
  Utilize the Canvas API for rendering and animating the Game of Life grid. Itâ€™s efficient and well-suited for real-time simulations.

### Build & Bundling

- **Vite or Parcel (Optional):**  
  Use a lightweight bundler like Vite or Parcel to streamline development with live reloading and support for ES6 modules. For a very simple MVP, serving static files may be sufficient.

### Hosting

- **Static Hosting:**  
  Deploy the project on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. They offer free hosting for static sites, HTTPS, and continuous deployment.

### Rationale

- **Simplicity & Robustness:**  
  This stack avoids unnecessary complexity, focusing on technologies that are fast, reliable, and widely supported.
- **Low Learning Curve:**  
  These technologies are well-documented and broadly used, allowing for rapid development and easy future enhancements.
- **Scalability:**  
  The setup provides a solid base that can evolve. Future enhancements (e.g., introducing React or Web Workers) can be added without a complete overhaul.
