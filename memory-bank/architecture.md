## Files and Components

### HTML (src/index.html)
The main HTML file serves as the entry point for the application. It defines:
- Document metadata (charset, viewport, description)
- Basic page structure with header, main content area, and footer
- Canvas element (800x600 pixels) for the Game of Life grid
- Placeholder containers for:
  - Simulation controls
  - Pattern selection
  - Analytics display
- Links to the CSS and JavaScript files

### CSS (src/styles.css)
This file will contain all styles for the application, focusing on:
- Responsive layout
- Canvas styling and positioning
- UI controls appearance
- Typography and visual hierarchy

### JavaScript (src/script.js)
This will contain the core functionality of the simulator:
- Canvas initialization and grid rendering
- Game of Life simulation logic
- User interaction handlers
- Pattern management
- Analytics calculations

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - HTML for structure
   - CSS for presentation
   - JavaScript for behavior

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient canvas rendering
   - Optimized simulation algorithms

4. **Modularity**
   - Clear separation between UI elements
   - Organized code structure for future extensions
