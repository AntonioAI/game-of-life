# Project Progress Tracker

## Completed Steps

### 2023-03-24: Implemented Step 2.1 - HTML Skeleton
- Created basic HTML structure in `src/index.html`
- Added responsive meta tags
- Set up canvas element with dimensions 800x600 pixels
- Created placeholder sections for controls, patterns and analytics
- Added empty CSS and JS files as scaffolding
- Created README.md with project description and structure

### 2023-03-24: Implemented Step 2.2 - Basic CSS Styling
- Developed comprehensive CSS styling in `src/styles.css`
- Implemented responsive layout using flexbox and media queries
- Ensured canvas is properly centered and scales on different devices
- Applied minimalist, modern design with clear visual hierarchy
- Used CSS variables for consistent color scheme
- Added subtle shadows and borders for visual depth
- Implemented responsive behavior for mobile, tablet, and desktop views

### 2023-03-24: Implemented Step 3.1 - Set Up the Canvas Element
- Initialized the HTML5 Canvas in `src/script.js`
- Created a grid system with default size of 50x50 cells
- Implemented drawing functions with light gray grid lines
- Added a settings panel for grid customization
- Created preset options (50x50, 75x75, 100x100)
- Implemented custom size input functionality
- Added responsive styling for the settings panel

### 2023-03-24: Implemented Step 3.2 - Implement Cell Toggling Functionality
- Added functionality to toggle cells between alive and dead states with mouse clicks
- Implemented cross-browser compatible event handling
- Added support for touch events on mobile devices
- Created coordinate translation system for accurate cell targeting
- Prevented default behaviors (like right-click menu) for smoother experience
- Ensured proper event cleanup to avoid memory leaks
- Validated cell coordinates to prevent out-of-bounds errors

### 2023-03-25: Implemented Step 4.1 - Define the Simulation Rules
- Implemented Conway's Game of Life rules (underpopulation, survival, overcrowding, reproduction)
- Created a neighbor counting function with optimized boundary handling
- Added toroidal grid wrapping (edges connect) as the default boundary type
- Implemented a finite grid boundary option as an alternative
- Added UI control to toggle between boundary types
- Developed a step function to advance the simulation by one generation
- Ensured accurate cell state calculation based on the current grid state
- Added a "Step" button to manually advance the simulation one generation at a time
- Created a "Glider" test pattern button to verify the simulation rules work correctly

### 2023-03-25: Implemented Step 4.2 - Integrate the Simulation Loop
- Created a main simulation loop using requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Added controls to start, pause, step, and reset the simulation
- Implemented a speed control slider to adjust simulation speed (1-60 FPS)
- Created analytics display showing current generation and live cell count
- Added visual feedback for active/inactive simulation controls
- Ensured performance optimization by only updating when needed
- Implemented responsive design for simulation controls
- Added proper cleanup of animation frames when pausing
- Ensured cross-browser compatibility for all simulation functions

### 2023-03-26: Implemented Step 5.1 - Develop UI Controls for the Simulation
- Added clear, user-friendly control panel with Start, Pause, Step, and Reset buttons
- Implemented visual feedback with button state changes (enabled/disabled, primary button highlighting)
- Created a speed control slider with adjustable simulation speed (1-60 FPS)
- Added visual indicators for active simulation state
- Improved button styling with hover and active states for better UX
- Enhanced analytics display with clear formatting and improved styling
- Reorganized layout with a sidebar for better organization of controls and analytics
- Ensured responsive design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- Added emoji icons to buttons for improved visual recognition
- Implemented proper state management between control actions

## In Progress

### Step 5.2 - Implement Basic Analytics Display
- Status: Awaiting validation of 5.1 before beginning

## Next Steps
- Await validation of Step 5.1 implementation
- Proceed with Step 5.2 - Implement Basic Analytics Display

## Notes for Future Developers
- The HTML structure follows a modular approach with separate containers for different UI elements
- CSS uses a mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 480px and 768px
- The canvas element is set to scale responsively while maintaining aspect ratio
- Color scheme is defined using CSS variables for easy theming in the future
- Layout changes from column (mobile) to row (desktop) for better space utilization
- Grid settings can be customized through the UI with validation for size constraints
- Cell toggling works on both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) devices
- The simulation implements both toroidal (wrapping) and finite grid boundaries
- The algorithm for computing the next generation follows Conway's rules accurately
- The step function can be used to advance the simulation by one generation at a time
- The simulation loop uses requestAnimationFrame for optimal performance
- Analytics display shows live statistics of the simulation
- Control buttons provide visual feedback via state changes (enabled/disabled, highlighted when active)
