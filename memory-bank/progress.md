- Proceed with Step 4.2 - Integrate the Simulation Loop

## Notes for Future Developers
- The HTML structure follows a modular approach with separate containers for different UI elements
- CSS uses a mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 480px and 768px
- The canvas element is set to scale responsively while maintaining aspect ratio
- Color scheme is defined using CSS variables for easy theming in the future
- Layout changes from column (mobile) to row (desktop) for better space utilization
- Grid settings can be customized through the UI with validation for size constraints
- Cell toggling works on both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) devices
