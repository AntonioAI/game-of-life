# Detailed Implementation Plan â€“ Game of Life Simulator MVP

## 1. Project Setup and Environment

### Step 1.1: Initialize the Repository
- **Task:** Create a new Git repository for the MVP project.
- **Instructions:** Set up a repository structure that includes folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets.
- **Test:** Confirm that the repository contains the expected folders and that initial commits are made with a README.md.

### Step 1.2: Set Up Development Environment
- **Task:** Choose a lightweight bundler (optional) such as Vite or Parcel, or plan to serve static files.
- **Instructions:** Configure the chosen tool (if used) to support ES6 modules and live reloading.
- **Test:** Run the development server and verify that changes in your files trigger a reload in the browser.

## 2. Build the Basic Front-End Structure

### Step 2.1: Create the HTML Skeleton
- **Task:** Create an HTML file (index.html) with a basic structure.
- **Instructions:** Include the necessary meta tags for responsiveness and a placeholder `<canvas>` element for the simulation. Set the canvas size to 800x600 pixels.
- **Test:** Open the HTML file in a browser and verify that the page loads with an empty canvas of the correct dimensions.

### Step 2.2: Add Basic CSS Styling
- **Task:** Develop a CSS file (styles.css) to provide minimal styling.
- **Instructions:** Ensure the layout is responsive and the canvas is centered on the page. Use a minimalist, modern design with clear visual hierarchy.
- **Test:** Resize the browser window and verify that the layout adapts correctly across different device sizes.

## 3. Develop the Interactive Simulation Canvas

### Step 3.1: Set Up the Canvas Element
- **Task:** In your JavaScript file, initialize the HTML5 Canvas and set its dimensions.
- **Instructions:** Create a grid on the canvas that will represent the Game of Life cells. Use a default grid of 50x50 cells with light gray grid lines. Implement a settings panel to allow users to resize the grid with presets (50x50, 75x75, 100x100) or custom dimensions.
- **Test:** Render the canvas grid in the browser. Verify that the grid lines appear as expected and that the canvas scales properly.

### Step 3.2: Implement Cell Toggling Functionality
- **Task:** Allow users to toggle cells between "alive" and "dead" states by clicking on the canvas.
- **Instructions:** Add event listeners for mouse click (and touch events on mobile) to update the state of individual cells. Use solid black color for live cells and white for dead cells.
- **Test:** Click on several grid cells and visually confirm that their state changes between black (alive) and white (dead).

## 4. Implement Simulation Logic

### Step 4.1: Define the Simulation Rules
- **Task:** Implement the logic for Conway's Game of Life rules (underpopulation, survival, overcrowding, reproduction).
- **Instructions:** Create a function to compute the next generation of cells based on the current grid state. Implement toroidal grid wrapping (edges connect) as the default, with an option to toggle to a finite grid.
- **Test:** Prepare a small test pattern (e.g., a glider or blinker) on the grid and run the simulation step. Confirm that the resulting cell pattern matches expected outcomes.

### Step 4.2: Integrate the Simulation Loop
- **Task:** Create a simulation loop that updates the grid at a set interval.
- **Instructions:** Use `requestAnimationFrame` to achieve a target frame rate of 30 FPS. Include optimizations for performance, such as only updating active regions and considering sparse data structures for larger grids.
- **Test:** Start the simulation and verify that the grid updates over time with smooth transitions between generations, maintaining close to 30 FPS performance.

## 5. Build Simulation Controls and Basic Analytics

### Step 5.1: Develop UI Controls for the Simulation
- **Task:** Add buttons for Start, Pause, Step, and Reset, and a slider or input for simulation speed.
- **Instructions:** Create a control panel that is clearly visible and user-friendly. The Step button should advance the simulation by one generation.
- **Test:** Click each control and verify:
  - **Start:** The simulation begins updating.
  - **Pause:** The simulation stops updating.
  - **Step:** The simulation advances by exactly one generation.
  - **Reset:** The grid returns to its initial state.
  - **Speed Slider:** Adjusting the slider changes the update frequency.

### Step 5.2: Implement Basic Analytics Display
- **Task:** Add visual elements (text or small panels) to display the current generation count and live cell count.
- **Instructions:** Update these elements each time the simulation advances.
- **Test:** Observe the analytics panel during simulation. Confirm that the generation number increments and that the live cell count reflects the current grid state accurately.

## 6. Create Pattern Library

### Step 6.1: Implement Initial Cell Patterns
- **Task:** Create a set of predefined patterns that users can select and place on the grid.
- **Instructions:** Implement the following patterns:
  - **Still Lifes:** Block, Beehive, Boat, Loaf
  - **Oscillators:** Blinker, Toad, Pulsar
  - **Spaceships:** Glider, Lightweight Spaceship (LWSS)
  - **Growth Patterns:** R-pentomino, Gosper Glider Gun
- **Test:** Load each pattern and verify it displays correctly on the grid. Run the simulation to confirm each pattern behaves as expected.

### Step 6.2: Develop Pattern Selection Interface
- **Task:** Create a gallery view for pattern selection with thumbnail previews.
- **Instructions:** Design an intuitive interface where users can browse and select patterns. Include tooltips or short descriptions for each pattern.
- **Test:** Click on different patterns in the gallery and verify they load correctly onto the grid.

## 7. Ensure Responsive and Cross-Browser Compatibility

### Step 7.1: Responsive UI Testing
- **Task:** Test the layout on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Instructions:** Use browser tools and real devices to simulate various resolutions.
- **Test:** Confirm that the canvas and control panel are properly displayed and usable on all target devices.

### Step 7.2: Cross-Browser Testing
- **Task:** Test the MVP on multiple browsers and versions.
- **Instructions:** Ensure compatibility with:
  - Chrome: Version 60+
  - Firefox: Version 60+
  - Safari: Version 10+
  - Edge: Version 15+
  - Mobile: iOS Safari 11+ and modern Android browsers
- **Test:** Manually test core functionality (grid rendering, cell toggling, simulation loop, controls, and analytics) on each browser.

## 8. Deployment

### Step 8.1: Prepare for Static Hosting Deployment
- **Task:** Finalize the build process and ensure that all files are optimized and error-free.
- **Instructions:** Minify assets if needed and set up a simple build script.
- **Test:** Run a final local test with the production build.

### Step 8.2: Deploy to a Static Hosting Service
- **Task:** Upload the project to a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
- **Instructions:** Follow the chosen platform's guidelines for deploying static websites.
- **Test:** Access the live site from multiple devices and verify that all MVP features work as expected.

## 9. Post-Deployment Validation

### Step 9.1: User Feedback and Metrics Collection
- **Task:** Set up basic logging or feedback forms to capture user interactions and issues.
- **Instructions:** Implement tracking for:
  - **User Engagement:** Unique visitors, session durations, session frequency
  - **Feature Usage:** Control clicks, speed slider usage, grid resizing
  - **Pattern Selection:** Most frequently selected patterns, time spent on selection vs. simulation
  - **Performance:** Average frame rate, browser/device types
- **Test:** Verify that metrics are being collected accurately and that feedback mechanisms are working properly.

### Step 9.2: Performance Monitoring and Optimization
- **Task:** Monitor the application's performance post-launch and make necessary optimizations.
- **Instructions:** Analyze collected metrics to identify performance bottlenecks or usability issues.
- **Test:** Implement optimizations based on real-world usage data and verify improvements.
